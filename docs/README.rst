``VICE Documentation``
======================

This directory contains all of ``VICE``'s documentation, which comes in two 
forms. 



.. 							SCIENCE DOCUMENTATION 
Science Documentation
---------------------
``VICE``'s `science documentation`__ provides detail on the analytic motivation 
and numerical approximations of the implemented equations. While it is not 
intended as a review of galactic chemical evolution modeling, it should provide 
answers to many technical research-related questions specific to its 
implementation.

__ scidocs_ 



..							USER'S GUIDE 
User's Guide
------------
``VICE``'s `user's guide`__ provides the standard 
``python`` documentation for functions and classes. For each class and 
function: a short description of what it does, its signature, 
attributes/parameters, what it returns, what exceptions it raises, and example 
code. This should provide answers to many implementation-related questions.

For First-Time Users
====================
We recommend that first-time users read through the QuickStartTutorial 
``ipython notebook``. This is intended to familiarize them with how to use 
all of ``VICE``'s features. 


Figures
=======
We also provide separate copies of the figures in ``VICE``'s 
`science documentation`__. See sections 2.2, 2.3, and 7 for the relevant 
details.
