    "This is intended to show users how to get VICE up and running to answer their research questions as quickly as possible. VICE makes it trivially easy for users to specify their own nucleosynthetic yields for various elements from core-collapse and type Ia supernovae, gas outflows, outflow metallicities, delay-time distributions for type Ia supernovae, star formation efficiencies, and inflow metallicities. This is only a sample of the parameters the user can customize in VICE; specifically they are the ones which the user can set to an arbitrary mathematical function. They will be interpreted as functions of time in Gyr or metallicity Z, depending on the parameter. In this way, VICE achieves the capability of simulating one-zone models of galactic chemical enrichment for arbitrarily complex parameters. \n",
